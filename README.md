# FlaskPerceptron

A simple Python script that uses a perceptron made by S. ZajÄ…c during a RTA class based on Iris dataset. 

The perceptron is pickled and unpickled by the app.py which hosts it using Flask.

A dockerfile is included that will create a running docker image of the application if all files are in the same folder.
