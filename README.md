# FlaskPerceptron

A simple Python script that uses a perceptron made by S. ZajÄ…c during a RTA class based on Iris dataset. 

The perceptron is defined and pickled by perceptron.py and unpickled and used as its model by app.py which hosts it using Flask.

A dockerfile is included that will create a running docker image of the application if all files are in the same folder.

FlaskPerceptronImage.tar is a tar file with the entire image already created.
